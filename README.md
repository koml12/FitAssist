# FitAssist
 
This repo is an extension of the [Workout Tracker](https://github.com/koml12/WorkoutTracker) project, with some extensions and general improvements.
 
 
## To Do
+ Separate screen that guides the user through the workout (like the one in WorkoutTracker, but without the bugs).
+ Rep range support, i.e. instead of a whole number for reps each time, have a range that the user can manully input every time.
+ Weight tracking on exercises.
+ Auto weight progression, configure the progression amount in the workout settings.
+ Calendar to schedule workouts with notifications when they are coming up.

### Current Focus: Multiple Workouts
+ Pass over workout name to the exercise list view, so the user knows what workout they are looking at.
+ Fix back button navigation through Fragments throughout the whole app.
+ Refactor and document code.
+ Write some tests to make sure everything is working normally.
